# W.I.P.

A stripped down and embeddable implementation of a DataDog agent in golang.

Five objectives:
1. Extremely simple setup
2. Few dependencies, all of them must be from std lib
3. Push metrics
4. Push logs
5. Sending in chunks using a concurrent goroutine

TODO:
* Logs
* Finish the agent
* Refactor
* Testing
